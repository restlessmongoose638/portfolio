            <p>For UI/UX, I designed an interactive interface that allows users to filter and sort an array.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Users need to be able to sort through large lists with speed and accuracy.</p>
            <p><strong>Research:</strong> I determined what categories are most useful for this particular demographic (by author, by title) to 
          and sorted the information accordingly. </p>
            <p><strong>Design Iterations:</strong> I made it possible to apply multiple filters because genres and age rage are both relevant to 
          finding a book.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While applying as many filters as possible allows users to find something they may already know they are looking for,
          it is important for the initial design to be as intuitive as possible as well. </p>

            <p>For UI/UX, I prototyped a market platform for convenience store owners and stock suppliers.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> This platform must accomodate two user groups with visual consistency and simplicity.</p>
            <p><strong>Research:</strong> My team and I conducted user testing in order to meet the needs of the average user and determine the efficacy of our designs.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Iterations:</strong> My team and I created multiple prototypes, after settling on a theme, to better organize the overall layout. </p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Standardizing as much of the prototype as possible improved user experience and navigation. </p>

            <p>For UI/UX, I designed an interactive interface that responds to changing screen dimensions.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> The College Hill Independent website currently has fixed dimensions and an unintuitive design.</p>
            <p><strong>Research:</strong> I determined how users move through magazine websites and reorganized the page to emphasize this process. </p>
            <p><strong>Design Iterations:</strong> I decided ultimately to keep the featuerd article structure because that was important for 
            gathering attention. </p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Improving the accessibility of this design and forefronting the individual sections improved user experience 
            without too drastically destabilizing how one moves through the website. </p>

            <p>For UI/UX, I developed a user profile and user journey for the CVS self-checkout interface.</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> The CVS self-checkout interface is somewhat frustrating but not much has been done to understand why.</p>
            <p><strong>Research:</strong> I interviewed subjects in front of the interface.   </p>
            <p><strong>Design Iterations:</strong>  I tried to keep the write up website simple to emphasize the user experience. </p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> It is essential to talk to and observe real users to understand the full user experience. </p>
